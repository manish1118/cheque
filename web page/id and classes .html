	<p>learn about ids and classes:-
	we can give a specific id to a tag
	then apply styling to that id in css file
	we can give only one id to the html element
	in css file we use "#" name of the id to call the element
	we can also specify the class for the html elements
	it started with "."name "{}" we put attributes in the curly bracess
	we can use as many classes as we want to use in a single html element 
	but only one id thus classes are better then the ids
	ids are used as identifier , we can identify the html element with it 
	where as classes are used to store bunch of css elements
